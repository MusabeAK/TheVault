<h1>THE VAULT SYSTEM</h1>

<h2>About The Vault System</h2>

<p>The Vault System is an innovative solution designed to enhance safety and security to people’s belongings.</p>

<p>The Vault System is a system that is embedded into a vault to integrate with the lock system and improve the security of a safe.</p>

<p>This system provides secure access control, monitoring, and management features for protecting valuable assets.</p>

<p>The system utilizes the powerful ATmega2560 Pro Arduino Board as its core, this system also integrate sensors like Gas,
  Temperature, Sound, location  to detect potential fire hazards, change in temperature, noise fluctuations and movements around the vault and 
  control access to people’s belongs using a keypad.</p>

<h2>Access Management</h2>
<p>This is the main function of this vault system, and it is achieved with the help of a door system.</p>
<p>The door system contains:</p>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>a motor which is used to lock and unlock the door.</span><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>a keypad to enter pin</span><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>the LCD screen for display and LED lights (yellow, blue and red)</span><br><br>
<p>At default state, the LCD displays “The Vault” for 5 seconds, then “ENTER PIN”</p>

<h2>FUTURE WORKS : Fire Detection System</h2>
<p>The idea is to guard the safe from intruders who are going to use fire to access the valuable assets.</p> 
<p>Through the gas sensors the system will be able to detect smoke around the vault. </p>
<p>The moment smock is detected,  the buzzer emits sounds continuously, the red LED blinks continuously, as the LCD displays “FIRE DETECTED”.</p> 
<p>This is done until the smoke is no longer detected.</p>

<h2>Data Management</h2>
<p>Temperature, Humidity and Sound levels are some of the Key data that are detected by the system through the respective sensors.</p>
<p>The Data is then sent to Things Speak where it is monitored from.</p>
